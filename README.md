In this project we implemented a strategy of image separation based on its content without necessarily having to use other images for it. The strategy consists of establishing a relationship between the number of lines in the image and the number of simple shapes such as squares and circles.
This relationship will generate a ranking that will be used to name the images and thus allows orderly visualization in the file system.

A sample image set is available for testing.
Running the program generates new ordered images in the resources / result folder.
